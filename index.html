        <p> Sloth animals have a wondrous appearance, they are almost no tails, no ears, and their noses are sleet. She has pig-like teeth and long and rough hair. They are gray in some species, making it difficult to see them between branches. A sleeping sloth looks like an abscess, especially when green algae grow on its hair, as is the case with many sloths. The sloth rarely descends to the ground. These animals are fed with leaves, buds and small branches </p>
